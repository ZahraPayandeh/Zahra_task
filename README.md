How to Run the Script
To run the ZP_CSV Assignment.py script, follow these steps:

Ensure Python is Installed:

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Download the Required Files:

Ensure you have the input.csv file in the same directory as your script. This file is necessary for the script to run correctly. Note that, I have re-named this file as: brca_cnvs_tcga-1-2 (1).csv
The input.csv file is included in the repository, so you don’t need to download it separately. 

I have used Visual Studio Code and my OS is Windows. You can run the script using any command line shell (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.), not just Visual Studio Code.
Navigate to the Script Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your ZP_assignment.py and input.csv files are located. For example:
cd path\to\your\directory
Run the Script:

Execute the script with the following command:
python ZP_assignment.py
Important Notes
File Paths: Ensure that the paths to the input files (like input.csv) are correctly set in the script. The paths may differ on your system, so adjust them as necessary.
Dependencies: Check any dependencies required by the script, and install them using pip if necessary.
